## Hello Hello ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to StudyingSpots ðŸ“šðŸ“™   

### The project idea

The heart and inspiration for this project is based on a common everyday problem.    

Sometimes it is hard to find a good place to study at or that has all the amenities that you might want such as near coffee shops,     
food, printing centers, water fountains or bathrooms. Other things, like a quite or not so quite place are important too. 

### Who we are 
We are a team of students collaborating between semesters so it is a medium-term project 

### The tools that we are using 
We are planning to make this using two different stacks of technogies: 
* Vanilla JavaScript, CSS & HTML 
* MERN - MongoDB, Espress, React & Node js.

Why? 
We are aware that the choice of techonogy impacts the development process of any product, so we will like to compare them ourselves.  
Also, because we want to learn the languages for what they are without any external frameworks, as well as learning that framework too. 

Everyone on the team is at a different level so we are taking it easy!

Once this project is completed, we will share it with the world! ðŸ˜€
